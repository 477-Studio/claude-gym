# Contributing to Claude Gym

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started.

## Dev Environment Setup

**Requirements:**
- Go 1.25+
- CGO enabled (`CGO_ENABLED=1` — Raylib needs C bindings)
- Linux only: `sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev libxi-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxxf86vm-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev`

**Clone and build:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/477-Studio/claude-gym.git
cd claude-gym
go build -o cgym .
```

**Run:**

```bash
./cgym                          # Watch current project
./cgym watch ~/path/to/project  # Watch specific project
./cgym replay <file.jsonl>      # Replay a conversation
```

**Studio mode** (for sprite/animation development):

```bash
go build -tags debug -o cgym . && ./cgym studio
```

## Adding a New Exercise

1. Add a new row to the spritesheet in `assets/developer/exercise_spritesheet.png` (32x32 pixel frames, 16 frames per animation)
2. Add an entry to `exercises.json`:
   ```json
   {"name": "Your Exercise", "anim_row": <row_number>, "reps": "10 reps"}
   ```
3. Test in studio mode to verify the animation looks right

The spritesheet is generated by the Python scripts in `cmd/devsprite/`. You can modify `generate_exercises.py` to add new exercise animations programmatically.

## Project Structure

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full architecture details. Key files:

- `main.go` — entry point, game loop, event handling
- `menu.go` — exercise flow state machine
- `exercises.go` — exercise config loader
- `animations.go` — animation state machine
- `watcher.go` — JSONL file watcher and event parser
- `renderer*.go` — rendering (sprites, UI, biome)
- `exercises.json` — exercise definitions

## PR Process

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test locally (`go build -o cgym . && ./cgym`)
5. Open a PR against `main`

## Good First Issues
